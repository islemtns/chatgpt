ChatGPT
This project aims to create a console-based chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3. It is implemented using Python and some external libraries such as OpenAI, colorama, smtplib, imaplib, quopri, os, threading, pyautogui, time, pyAesCrypt, getpass, and subprocess. The bot can answer questions based on past conversations with the user and send and receive emails. It can also encrypt files and create notes.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have a valid API key from OpenAI. After that, you can download the project files and run them in a Python environment. You will also need to install the required external libraries using pip.

Usage
